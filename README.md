In this Project I have Implemented the Form Whenever a User or student fill the details and click submit, It will create record and send Text Message to entered Mobile Number.

In this project we have used the third party api(Twilio) to send text message.
To recieve/sned text message you have to open twilio account and register some mobile number in twilio.
